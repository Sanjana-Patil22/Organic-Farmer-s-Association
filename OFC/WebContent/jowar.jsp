    <h1>JOWAR</h1>

    <h4>Introduction to Organic Jowar Farming :</h4>

    Jowar is one of the top cereal crops in the world, along with oats, wheat, corn, rice, and barley. Jowar is one of the cereal crops that can be used for food and feed. It has wide adaptability and tolerance to environmental stress. An annual grass that is very drought tolerant, Jowar is an excellent choice for arid and dry areas. It has special adaptations to climate extremes and is a very stable source of nutrition as a result. It is most commonly red and hard when ripe and is usually dried after harvesting for longevity, as the grains are stored whole. Jowar can be harvested mechanically, although higher crop losses will result if the Jowar is too moist.

    <h4>A Step By Step Guide to Organic Jowar Farming :</h4>

    The nutritional value of Jowar is similar to that of corn and that is why it is gaining importance as livestock feed. Jowar is also used for ethanol production, producing grain alcohol, starch production, production of adhesives and paper other than being used as food and feed for livestock. Organic Jowar cultivation is gaining popularity due to its nature of extreme drought tolerance. Jowar is very nutritious just like corn and can be used as green fodder, dry fodder, hay, or silage. Jowar is a vigorous, hardy, and drought-tolerant crop, which grows up to 4 meters tall and has a high potential yield. It is a perennial grass but is mostly cultivated as an annual crop. Jowar can go into dormancy during drought conditions and resume growth when the rains come because it has a more efficient root system than most cereal crops (except millet) and rolls its leaves to reduce evapotranspiration.

    <h4>Varieties of Jowar</h4>

    The best varieties of Jowar are,
    <ul>
        <li>Grain Jowar is also called milo, produces tall panicles covered with small, round seeds in late summer. The grain Jowar can be milled into fresh flour, and some varieties such as ‘Tarahumara’ can be popped like popcorn. Cracked grain Jowar makes excellent animal feed.</li>

        <li>Sweet Jowar, is also called cane Jowar, is grown for the sweet juice that is extracted from the tall stalks. The ‘Dale’ variety is produced in a range of climates, or you can try heirloom sweet Jowar varieties like ‘Rox Orange’ Or ‘Sugar Drip.’</li>

        <li>Broom corn is one type of Jowar that holds its seeds on sturdy straws, perfect for trimming into brooms. The ornamental tops can also use in dried arrangements. Broom corn varieties vary in the colour of the seeds, which may be black, red, orange or white. The seeds are eagerly eaten by chickens and other animals and are most palatable when cracked.</li>
    </ul>   

    <h4>Organic Soil Preparation for Jowar Farming :</h4>

    The various soil types viz., vertisols, entisols, inceptisols, or alfisols are suitable for growing Jowar. Vertisols with better cation exchange capacity, higher nutrient status, and water retention support the good crop. The crop is grown successfully on soil with pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.5. It tolerates salinity and alkalinity. Under good climatic conditions, Jowar does best on deep fertile soils. It is adapted to poor soils and can grow well on soils where many other crops would fail. Soil fertility is a crucial factor in the success of Jowar yield. When managing soil nutrients for Jowar it is important to consider the soil type, organic content matter within the soil as well as soil pH value. Factoring in the soil’s crop history, what was planted the previous year, is crucial, especially if the previous crop was a legume like alfalfa or soybeans. Knowing the manure application history can also help you understand your soil’s fertility.
    
    <h4>Crop rotation in Jowar Farming :</h4>

    Crop rotation is a cultural management method that involves alternate use of nonhost and host crops in a field to reduce insect pest abundance and damage. Jowar benefits most when rotated with a broadleaf or tap rooted crop such as cotton, or soybean. Growing Jowar in a field planted to a different, nonhost crop the earlier year significantly decreases the abundance of some insect pests, as well as some diseases and weeds.

    <h4>Seed Rate and Sowing in Organic Jowar Farming :</h4>

    A seed rate of 5 to 6 kg seed per acre is sufficient to ensure a good stand of the crop. Sowing should be carried out by drilling by a row-to-row distance of 25 cm. Seed broadcasting should be avoided. The seed should not be sowed more than 2 to 3 cm depth.The seeds are sown in rows 45 cm apart with a plant to plant distance of 12 cm and at a depth of 3 to 4 cm. Sown the Jowar seeds either by broadcasting or in rows behind the plough. In northern India, Jowar is sown only during the Kharif season.

    <h4>Planting Time in Planting Method in Organic Jowar Farming :</h4>

    Planting time of Jowar in most locales should be as early as practical but not when soil is too cool for rapid seed germination and seedling growth. In many areas, early planting takes advantage of seasonal rainfall. Planting early avoids damage and infestation because the Jowar plant is beyond the vulnerable stage when some insect pests are abundant enough to cause damage, or at the very least, the crop is susceptible for a shorter period

    <h4>Organic Fertilizers and Manures in Jowar Farming :</h4>

    Smallholder farmers rarely apply commercial fertilizers. But the application of farmyard manure or ash is quite common. Application of organic fertilizers like animal manure or compost to the field increases the water storage capacity of the soil and provides nutrients to the soil. Better availability of water and nutrients results in higher grain yields of Jowar. The nutrient requirements of the crop are highest during rapid growth and early bloom. Requirements of the main nutrient’s nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for an average yield of 7,500 kg per hectare are 185 kg N, 80 kg P2O5, and 285 kg K2O. Without any provision of nutrients, production depends on soil- stored nutrients only, which in poor soils will give low yields.

    <h4>Irrigation Requirements in Organic Jowar Farming :</h4>

    If the crop is sown in monsoon time (July) and it may require l to 3 irrigations depending upon rains.For summer crops, 6 to 7 irrigations may be carried out due to high temperatures. In South India, Rabi season crops need about 4 to 5 irrigations. <br> 
    Irrigation helps Jowar crop through;
    <ul>
        <li>Allows efficient use of inputs</li>
        <li>Increases yield</li>
        <li>Improves the quality of grain</li>
        <li>Improves reliability and reduces risk</li>
        <li>Increases profitability</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h4>When and How to Harvest Jowar :</h4>

    The best time for harvest is when grains become hard and contain less than 25% moisture. Once the crop gets mature, harvest it immediately. For harvesting, sickles are used. The plants are cut from near the ground level. After then stalks are tied into bundles of convenient sizes and stacked on the threshing floor. After 2 to 3 days removed ear heads from plants. In some cases, only ear heads are removed from the standing crop and collected on the threshing floor. After then they are sundry for 3 to 4 days.
